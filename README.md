## ü§ñ AI Models

The application uses custom-trained YOLO11 models specifically designed for leukemia cell detection:

| Model | Description | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `yolo11l_v5_3` | Large model variant |  |
| `yolo11x_v5_3` | Extra-large model (v3) |  |
| `yolo11x_v5_4` | Extra-large model (v4) |  |

All models are automatically downloaded on first use and cached locally for faster subsequent runs.

## üìñ Usage Guide

### 1. **Select Your Model**
Choose from the available YOLO11 models in the sidebar. Larger models provide higher accuracy but require more processing time.

### 2. **Choose Input Source**
- **üì∏ Image**: Upload single blood smear images (JPG, PNG)
- **üé¨ Video**: Upload video files for frame-by-frame analysis  
- **üé• Webcam**: Real-time analysis (local) or single photo capture (cloud)

### 3. **Try Example Images**
Click on the provided example images to test the application:
- **Myeloblasts**: Example showing myeloblasts in peripheral blood
- **Neutrophils**: Example showing neutrophils in blood smear

### 4. **Configure Detection**
- **Classes**: Select specific cell types to detect
- **Confidence**: Set minimum confidence threshold (0.0-1.0)
- **IoU**: Adjust intersection over union for overlapping detections
- **Tracking**: Enable object tracking for videos and webcam

### 5. **Analyze Results**
- View original and annotated images side by side
- Check the results table for detected classes and confidence scores
- Download or save results as needed
